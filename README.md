# CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, and ships.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Steps
1. Data preprocessing
2. Model building (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense layers)
3. Training and evaluation
4. Achieved accuracy: 90.01%

## Future Work
- Apply data augmentation
- Add Dropout layers
- Explore transfer learning
