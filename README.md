# Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-on-CIFAR-10-Dataset
I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 images across 10 categories such as airplanes, cars, cats, and ships. The model was trained with convolution, pooling, and dense layers to classify images, achieving good accuracy on the test set.
